    <p class="text-align"> My name is Brian Ly, I was born in Garden Grove but grew up most of my life in Vietnam with my family. I am currently a Junior in Concordia University of Irvine and my major is Computer Science.My goal in the future is to develop the necessary skills to dive into the world of game design, and if that is not possible basic programming and software engineering would suffice.
        Basketball is my favorite sport to play and to watch in which my favorite team has always been the Lakers since I was a young child. Another hobby I like to participate in is gaming,
        I own a PC and various consoles throughout the years and experience many games as much as a movie junkie would watch every movie that would release.
